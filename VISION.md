# Future Direction

This document outlines where this theory leads.

---

## AI Interfaces

- chat-native by default
- structure layered on top, not forms
- interaction before commitment

---

## AI Safety

- reduce prediction dependence
- enforce structure and constraints
- allow decisions only after observation

---

## Human-AI Systems

- AI as intent discovery accelerator
- not answer generators
- not requirement fillers

---

## Complex Domains

Markets, research, policy, engineering:

- ambiguity is the norm
- pipelines collapse
- observation scales

---

## Closing

The next generation of AI systems
will not win by predicting harder.

They will win by **waiting correctly**.
