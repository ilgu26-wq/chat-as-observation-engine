# Chat Interface Efficiency Experiments

This document summarizes experiments comparing
three interface paradigms.

---

## Experimental Conditions

A — Free Chat  
B — Form / One-Shot  
C — V7-Structured Chat  
(STATE → Bar1 → Constraint → τ-plan)

---

## Tasks (6)

1. README restructuring
2. Experiment results → institutional report
3. File / folder + commit design
4. Document linking architecture
5. Single-image concept explanation
6. Two-minute interview explanation

---

## Metrics

- τ (turns to success)
- quality score (0–10)
- time to completion
- constraint violations
- convergence rate
- intent drift

---

## Results (Averages)

| Interface | Avg τ | Quality | Failure |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| Form / One-Shot | 1.8 | 5.3 | 67% |
| Free Chat | 6.0 | 6.9 | 0% |
| **V7-Structured** | **3.8** | **8.4** | **0%** |

---

## Key Findings

- form interfaces fail under ambiguity
- free chat works but is inefficient
- structure compresses τ without quality loss

As ambiguity increases,  
V7-Structured Chat becomes **more effective**, not less.

---

## Conclusion

Chat is not merely flexible.  
It is **structurally aligned with irreversible cognition**.
