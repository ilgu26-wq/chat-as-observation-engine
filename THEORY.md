# Irreversibility and Human Cognition

This document explains the theoretical foundation behind
chat as an observation engine.

## The Irreversibility Axiom

Before a decisive event occurs,  
information that determines the outcome **does not exist**.

This is not a limitation of models.
It is a property of reality.

---

## Intent Is Not Pre-Existing

Human intent is not fully formed at the start of interaction.

- goals are vague
- constraints are incomplete
- preferences are contradictory

Intent emerges **after engagement begins**.

## Bar1 in Cognition

In V7 terms:

- Bar1 marks the first irreversible informational event
- before Bar1, outcomes are undefined
- after Bar1, structure becomes observable

Conversation functions as a sequence of Bar1-like events.

## Why Prediction Fails

Prediction assumes:
- stable targets
- fixed intent
- reversible reasoning

Human decision-making violates all three.

Chat succeeds because it does not predict intent.
It **observes intent into existence**.

---

## Conclusion

Chat aligns with reality because it respects irreversibility.

It waits for structure to appear.
